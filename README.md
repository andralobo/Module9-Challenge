# Module 9 Challenge - Surfs Up
## Overview of the Surfs Up Analysis
### Purpose
W. Avy is opening a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii has asked us to analyse the temperatures for June and December.  
We have been given data from 2011-2017 broken down by day to include the temperatures and precipitation. We will use python, pandas and SQLAlchemy to complete our analysis.


## Surfs Up Analysis Results
Below are the results for temperatures in June and December

We can see that the following:

- The Average temperature is almost 4 degrees higher in June
- The minimum temperature is 8 degrees higher in June
- The maximum temperature is only 2 degrees higher in June

The charts below shows the average temperature for the month of June and December by year:

- May, July, August and September have the highest average temperatures
- January and Feburary have the lowest average temperatures.


## Surfs Up Analysis Summary
After pulling the temperatures for June and December we can see that the minimum temperature in December is much lower but it could because the nights are cooler than in June.  This probably means that the number of hours of daylight would be less in December and will have shorter amount of surfing hours.
